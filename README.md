# Chinese Traffic Signs Dataset

This dataset originates from the Chinese Traffic Sign Recognition Database and has been explored by members of the Riga Data Science Club for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We are pleased to share our work on Kaggle.

## About the Dataset

The dataset comprises images of Chinese traffic signs, collected from various sources and annotated for recognition tasks. Each image is labeled with the corresponding traffic sign class, enabling supervised learning tasks such as classification and detection.

## Usage

Researchers and practitioners can utilize this dataset for various computer vision tasks, particularly in the field of traffic sign recognition. The dataset's diversity and quality make it suitable for training and evaluating CNN models.

## Performance

We have experimented with several CNN architectures on this dataset to achieve high recognition accuracy. Our models have demonstrated robust performance across various traffic sign classes, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in traffic sign recognition.
